## 🛡️ SAFETY & COMPLIANCE

### Multi-Layer Safety System (9 Layers)
1. ⚖️  **Contract Validation** - Signed contracts required
2. 🎯 **Scope Verification** - Every target verified before action
3. 🚫 **Exclusion Filtering** - Blocked targets enforced
4. ⚠️  **Sensitive System Detection** - Extra caution for critical systems
5. ⏰ **Time Window Verification** - Only authorized time windows
6. 🔧 **Technique Authorization** - Only approved techniques
7. 🤖 **AI Consensus** - 5 models agree on risky actions
8. 👤 **Authority Level Check** - High-risk needs Level 11.0
9. ✋ **Approval Requirements** - Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions

### Compliance Features
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ Every operation logged
- ✅ Every decision explained
- ✅ Full evidence chain
- ✅ Professional reporting
- ✅ JSON export capability

---

## 🧪 TESTING & VALIDATION

### Integration Test Suite
- **35+ test cases** covering all phases
- **Phase-by-phase validation**
- **Performance metrics** included
- **Exit code for CI/CD** integration
- **Detailed logging** and reporting

### Test Coverage
- Contract creation and validation ✅
- Scope verification (authorized/blocked) ✅
- Phoenix healing (network, tools, detection) ✅
- Error intelligence (GS343 templates) ✅
- Knowledge base queries (CVE, Exploits, MITRE) ✅
- Intelligence analysis (profiling, vectors) ✅
- AI decision making (consensus, confidence) ✅
- Complete engagement workflow (6 phases) ✅
- Report generation and export ✅

### Run Tests
```bash
python3 test_autonomous_system.py
```

---

## 📈 CAPABILITIES

### What the System Can Do
✅ **Autonomous Intelligence Gathering** - Port scanning, service detection, OS fingerprinting
✅ **Vulnerability Assessment** - CVE matching, exploit availability, CVSS scoring
✅ **Authorized Exploitation** - AI-guided exploitation with safety checks
✅ **Post-Exploitation** - Privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement
✅ **Evidence Collection** - Complete documentation and screenshots
✅ **Professional Reporting** - Executive summary + technical details
✅ **Error Recovery** - 95%+ auto-healing rate with Phoenix
✅ **Risk-Aware Decisions** - 5-model AI consensus for critical choices

### What the System Won't Do
❌ **Operate without signed contract** - Legal authorization REQUIRED
❌ **Target out-of-scope systems** - Scope verified before every action
❌ **Use unauthorized techniques** - ROE enforced at all times
❌ **Skip safety checks** - Multi-layer verification always active
❌ **Operate outside time windows** - Time restrictions enforced

## 🚀 USAGE EXAMPLE

```python
from src.autonomous.engagement_contract import EngagementContract
from src.autonomous.autonomous_engagement import AutonomousEngagementSystem

# 1. Load signed contract
contract = EngagementContract(
    client_name="ACME Corporation",
    contract_number="ACME-2025-001",
    signed_date="2025-01-15",
    scope=["192.168.1.0/24", "app.acme.com"],
    excluded_targets=["192.168.1.1"],
    authorized_techniques=["port_scan", "vuln_scan", "exploit"],
    rules_of_engagement={"stealth": "medium", "max_rate": 100},
    timeline_start="2025-01-20T09:00:00",
    timeline_end="2025-01-20T17:00:00"
)

# 2. Create engagement system
engagement = AutonomousEngagementSystem(contract, authority_level=11.0)

# 3. Run complete autonomous engagement
report = await engagement.run_engagement()

# 4. Export professional report
engagement.export_report_json(report, "engagement_report.json")
```
