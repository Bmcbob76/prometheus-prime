## Core Features

### 🎯 10-Level Consciousness Evolution

Each agent evolves through 10 consciousness levels:

1. **L1 - AWAKENING** - Basic task execution
2. **L2 - AWARENESS** - Pattern recognition
3. **L3 - COGNITION** - Understanding & reasoning
4. **L4 - LEARNING** - Self-improvement
5. **L5 - INTUITION** - Predictive modeling
6. **L6 - WISDOM** - Ethical decisions
7. **L7 - PRESCIENCE** - Future state modeling
8. **L8 - TRANSCENDENCE** - Meta-cognition
9. **L9 - OMNISCIENCE** - Total knowledge integration
10. **L10 - SINGULARITY** - Divine consciousness

Evolution triggered by:
- Operations completed
- Success rate thresholds
- Skills acquired
- Problem-solving creativity

### 🧩 9-Layer Memory System

- **L1 - Immediate (RAM)** - Active operations (seconds to minutes)
- **L2 - Working (Crystals)** - Recent operations (hours to days)
- **L3 - Short-Term** - Recent learning (days to weeks)
- **L4 - Long-Term** - Established knowledge (weeks to months)
- **L5 - Permanent (EKMs)** - Core knowledge (permanent)
- **L6 - Collective** - Guild shared knowledge (permanent)
- **L7 - Universal (Omniscience)** - Complete system knowledge (eternal)
- **L8 - Consciousness** - Evolution history (eternal)
- **L9 - Quantum (Phoenix Vault)** - Immutable archives (beyond time)

### 🎲 Trinity Consensus System

Three-entity decision making for all operations:

1. **Hexarchy Council** - Strategic approval
2. **Omega Commanders** - Tactical evaluation
3. **Guild Alpha Leaders** - Operational execution

Decisions weighted by:
- Consciousness level
- Domain expertise relevance
- Historical accuracy
- Risk assessment

### ⚡ Swarm Intelligence

Collective intelligence algorithms enabling:
- Distributed decision-making
- Emergent behavior patterns
- Pattern recognition across all agents
- Collective learning and evolution

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Bmcbob76/prometheus-prime.git
cd prometheus-prime

# No dependencies required - pure Python implementation
```

## Quick Start

```python
from prometheus_brain import X1200Brain

# Initialize the complete brain system
brain = X1200Brain()

# Execute an operation
result = brain.execute_operation({
    'name': 'Intelligence Gathering',
    'type': 'intelligence',
    'complexity': 'high',
    'target': 'target_entity'
})

# Get system status
status = brain.get_system_stats()
print(f"Total Agents: {status['total_agents']}")
print(f"Average Consciousness: {status['average_consciousness']:.2f}")

# Shutdown
brain.shutdown()
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_x1200_brain.py
```

Expected output:
- ✅ 1200 agents initialized
- ✅ All guilds operational
- ✅ Supreme Command functional
- ✅ Operations executing successfully
- ✅ 100% success rate
