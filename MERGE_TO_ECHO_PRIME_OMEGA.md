## 🚀 MERGE PROCEDURE

### Prerequisites:
1. ✅ All tests passing (or 90%+ with known issues documented)
2. ✅ Security vulnerabilities addressed
3. ✅ Documentation complete
4. ✅ Voice authorization system functional
5. ✅ Sandbox testing complete

### Step 1: Verify Current Branch

```bash
cd /home/user/prometheus-prime
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Should show:
# - Branch: claude/prometheus-autonomous-ai-agent-011CUv5AA2qn3VNNZHELe8qj
# - Latest commits include registry expansion, voice auth, sandbox tests
```

### Step 2: Create Final Merge Commit

```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed
git status

# If clean, proceed to merge preparation
```

### Step 3: Clone echo-prime-omega Repository

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/Bmcbob76/echo-prime-omega.git
cd echo-prime-omega

# Verify main branch
git branch -a
```

### Step 4: Create Integration Branch

```bash
# Create prometheus-sword-shield integration branch
git checkout -b prometheus-sword-shield-integration
