## 🚀 QUICK START

### Prometheus Prime - Autonomous Engagement

```python
from Prometheus-Prime.src.autonomous.engagement_contract import create_example_contract
from Prometheus-Prime.src.autonomous.autonomous_engagement import AutonomousEngagementSystem

# Load signed contract
contract = create_example_contract()

# Create autonomous engagement system
engagement = AutonomousEngagementSystem(contract, authority_level=11.0)

# Run complete 6-phase engagement
report = await engagement.run_engagement()

# Export professional report
engagement.export_report_json(report, "engagement_report.json")
```

### Sovereign Override - Authority Level 11.0

```python
from Prometheus-Prime.src.autonomous.sovereign_override import SovereignArchitectOverride, BiometricType

# Initialize override system
override_system = SovereignArchitectOverride()

# Generate bloodline key (requires credentials + 2+ biometrics)
success, _, bloodline_key = override_system.generate_bloodline_key(
    sovereign_id="SOVEREIGN-001",
    credentials={"username": "sovereign", "password": "classified"},
    biometrics={
        BiometricType.FINGERPRINT: "fingerprint_hash",
        BiometricType.RETINA: "retina_hash"
    },
    authority_level=11.0
)

# Activate sovereign override (bypasses ALL safety protocols)
success, _, session = override_system.activate_sovereign_override(bloodline_key)

# Execute ANY operation on ANY target (with full advisory)
success, message, advisory = override_system.execute_with_override(
    target="ANY-TARGET",
    tool="ANY-TOOL",
    operation="ANY-OPERATION"
)
```
